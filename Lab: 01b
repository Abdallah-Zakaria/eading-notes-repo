# Growth Mindset

### My Words
_In my opinion i see the mindset is like the firewall to kick your negativity from your mind._

### Three Reminder to keep me in a growth mindset :
- I embrace __challenges__ rather than avoid them.
- I learn from __criticism__ rather than ignore it.
- When I __see other people's success__, Iinspired by them instead of I feel threatened and jealous.
